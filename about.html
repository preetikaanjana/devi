        <h1>About Me </h1>
        <p>As a girl growing up in a small village, I have witnessed firsthand the struggles faced by women in my community. Many of us live in a world where tradition dictates our lives, where the veil is not just a piece of cloth but a symbol of the restrictions we face. In my culture, it is common for young girls to marry by the age of 18 or even younger, often before they fully understand their rights or the choices available to them.</p>

    <p>In our village, women are expected to take a veil in front of their in-laws and any male visitors, reinforcing the notion that we are to be seen but not heard. This practice is deeply rooted in our culture and serves as a constant reminder of the limitations imposed upon us. From a young age, I watched as my friends and relatives accepted their roles without question, their dreams and aspirations buried under the weight of societal expectations. It was heartbreaking to see talented and intelligent girls who were forced to abandon their education and ambitions to fulfill familial duties.</p>

    <p>Education is a luxury that many women in my village cannot afford. Schools are often located far away, and families prioritize boys’ education over girls’. As a result, most girls never get the chance to explore their potential. Instead, they are taught to cook, clean, and prepare for their roles as wives and mothers. This cycle of ignorance perpetuates a lack of awareness about our rights. Many women don’t realize they have the right to inherit property, seek legal assistance, or even voice their opinions in their households. They grow up believing they have no choice but to remain in unhappy marriages, often facing emotional and physical abuse in silence.</p>

    <p>I have heard stories of women in my village who married young, believing it was their only option. They accepted their fate with resignation, often being confined to their homes and deprived of their individuality. I remember one particular friend who married at 17. She was bright and ambitious, but her dreams were extinguished the moment she said, "I do." Now, she is a mother, but the sparkle in her eyes has dimmed, replaced by the weight of her responsibilities.</p>

    <p>The defining moment for me came during a community meeting where women gathered to discuss health and well-being. I realized that many of us shared the same fears, doubts, and regrets. That day, I felt a fire ignite within me. I couldn’t stand by and watch my sisters suffer any longer. I decided to take action, to be a voice for those who felt voiceless.</p>

    <p>Thus, "SheKnows" was born. This platform is dedicated to educating and empowering women in rural areas about their rights and options. I want to create a space where women can learn about their legal protections, explore their dreams, and connect with resources that can help them. I believe that knowledge is power, and when women are informed about their rights, they can make choices that lead to freedom and independence.</p>

    <p>Through "SheKnows," I aim to share stories of resilience, strength, and courage. I want to highlight the importance of education, not just in schools but in our homes and communities. I want to encourage women to lift each other up, to stand together against the constraints that hold us back. My vision is for every woman to realize her potential, to understand that she is worthy of respect and has the right to make choices for her own life.</p>

    <p>In the end, my story is not just my own; it reflects the stories of countless women in my community who have faced similar struggles. Together, we can break the cycle of ignorance and pave the way for a brighter future, where every girl has the opportunity to pursue her dreams without fear or limitation. "SheKnows" is more than just a website; it is a movement to empower women, to embrace our rights, and to celebrate our freedom.</p>
